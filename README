| About |
==================
 
Rover is a Python tool for checking out code across heterogeneous version control repositories. Currently, the following SCMs are supported
 
    * cvs
    * svn
    * git (beta)
 
Contributors are always welcome to add their own additions. The following are potential extensions:
 
    * Mercurial
    * Bazaar
    * SVK
 
And more! If you use it, you can write a backend. Take a look at rover/backends/ for some examples; the rgit.py, rcvs.py, and rsvn.py are all great examples, and the syntax is easy to read.
