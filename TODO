  Configuration Changes/Improvements
================================================================================
- The CVS backend does not allow projects to checkout from more than one CVS
    repository, which stands at odds with the general idea of rover.  Similarly
    to SVN, it seems like it would be possible to add a CVSROOT field to the
    config file.

    How we prompt the user for passwords (as needed) is something that can be
    identified at a later time.  Storing passwords in the config is not a great
    idea.

- Give examples of checking out from multiple branches within the same module.

- Documentation.  For everything.  Especially the core rover scripts.


  Version Control Systems
================================================================================
- The more the merrier.
    * Bazaar
    * Mercurial
    * SVK
    etc.

- Take suggestions from future users, setup path with which users can suggest
    or submit new backends to support additional VCSs.


  Stability Issues
================================================================================
- Wrap errors with nicer messages, perhaps using one of the dozens of error
    modules currently available for Python.

- Test rover with varying forms of Python; currently, Python 2.5 and 2.6 are the
    only major versions known to work, and tested accordingly.

- Add checks to see if the version control systems are even on the system; i.e.,
    if attempting to checkout from git, display an appropriate error and a link
    to where it can be downloaded.


  Web Rover
================================================================================
- Add CherryPy as a requirement

- Create configuration file to set port number.
